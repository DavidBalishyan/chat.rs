# chat.rs
A chat server written entirely in Rust using the [**Tokio**](https://tokio.rs/) 
## Project setup
I made a bash script to setup and run the project for you. If you don't have sertain requirements installed, it will automatically install them
```bash
git clone https://github.com/DavidBalishyan/chat.rs.git
cd chat.rs
chmod +x ./run.sh
./run.sh <args>
```

**Find the client at [github.com/DavidBalishyan/chat-client.rs](https://github.com/DavidBalishyan/chat-client.rs)**

**Done!** Enjoy the app


This is a rewrite of my [**C-Chat**](https://github.com/DavidBalishyan12/C-Chat) project
